# T7-Phaseone-Firmware
Firmware used to interface with Phaseone via COM4. 

# What's new?

## Sending IMU angle
- Serial communication at 115200bps via COM4 of gimbal with level shifter
- Message format based on NEMA PASHR sentence
- Up to 50 messages/sec

- PhaseOne will retrieve the Heading, Roll and Pitch only, so custom message can be based on the following,
    " $GREMSYIMU,HHH.HH,T,RRR.RR,PPP.PP,ST*CS "
    + HHH.HH - Heading value in decimal degrees
    + T - displayed if heading is relative to true north or to heading of drone.
    + RRR.RR - Roll in decimal degrees.
    + PPP.PP - Pitch in decimal degrees.
    + ST – status of IMU information (valid/not valid…)
    + CS – checksum


## Control gimbal in the follow mode
- Gimbal allows control in follow mode by using remote  control or gSDK
